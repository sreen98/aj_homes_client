    question: '8.) Do I have to pay a deposit and is this amount refundable?',
    answer:
      'Yes, a security deposit is required in case of any damage or misuse of the property. The deposit is usually equivalent to 1 months rent, however this does depend on the landlord.

    question: '10.) How can I pay for my rent?',

Details about a standing order will be given to you once you have signed for your property. In exceptional circumstances other payment methods can be organised however you would need to tell us beforehand.'
