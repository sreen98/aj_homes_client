        <h2>Privacy Protection</h2>
        <p>
          This policy establishes how we handle information we learn about you when you visit our website. Protecting
          the privacy and personal data of our visitors is of utmost importance to us. Protecting your privacy and your
          personal data is an important aspect of the way we create, organise and implement our activities on-line and
          off-line.
        </p>

        <h2>Linkages Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to the AJ Homes & Lettings Limited, hereafter
          referred to as AJ Homes, (including all associated trading names) website. Other bodies/entities linked to the
          AJ Homes website may have different practices, though the commitment to your privacy will always be the same.
          You are encouraged to review the privacy statements of other bodies/entities when visiting their website(s).
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose Specifications and Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          In general, you can browse the AJ Homes website without disclosing any information about yourself. If you
          visit the AJ Homes website to read or download information, we collect and store only the following
          information that is automatically recognised: the date and time, the originating IP address, the domain name,
          the type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser), the URL of the referring page (if
          provided by the browser), the object requested and the completion status of the request.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          As described above, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to our site to help us provide
          better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure
          visitor activity on the AJ Homes website, but we do so in ways that keep information anonymous. We use the
          information that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our site, and to help
          us make the site more useful to visitors. This includes analysing these logs periodically to measure the
          traffic through our servers, the number of pages visited and the level of demand for pages and topics of
          interest. The logs may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way to prevent security
          breaches and to ensure the integrity of the data on our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect the anonymous information we mentioned above through the use of various technologies, one of which
          is called "cookies". A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be
          stored on your hard drive. For example, on a website with a login system (if users register for it), cookies
          are used to save the visitor's password so that it does not have to be entered at each new visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          This anonymous information is used and analysed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and
          patterns. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want any transaction
          details used in this manner, you can disable your cookies.
        </p>
